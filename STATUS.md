Battlegroup: `sh-db3533a2d5a25fb-xyyxbx` ("Slackware-Arrakis"), Phase: Healthy

Security audit state:

- `~/dune-server/scripts/security-audit.sh` reports the expected public Dune/RMQ ports only.
- Director, Filebrowser, Postgres, k3s API, and RabbitMQ admin ports stay private behind the host firewall.
- The audit is still useful after every gateway or update change, because Funcom patches can regenerate the gateway deployment and shift what is exposed.

## FLS server browser ✅ visible (as of 2026-05-14)

"Slackware-Arrakis" appears in the EXPERIMENTAL browser tab with "Arrakis-SlackwareLinux" (password-protected) below it. The "0 ms" ping shown is a Funcom-side display anomaly affecting every server in the list, not specific to ours.

### Likely root cause: stale build version

The server only became visible after updating from build `23147813` to `23216207` (battlegroup image `1957345-0-shipping`). The gateway `--RMQGameHttpPort=30196` fix was applied earlier the same day and did not produce visibility on its own — the version bump was the last thing changed before the browser showed the server.

Probable mechanism: FLS rejects outdated builds from the browser to prevent players from joining incompatible servers. Funcom does not document a minimum build requirement, but the behaviour fits.

**Future debugging**: if the server vanishes from the browser, *first* run `~/dune-server/scripts/update.sh` and wait at least 5 minutes for `DeclareBattlegroupUpdates` to re-fire. After a Funcom update, allow longer than a plain restart; fresh image pulls and first-run work can push that window past 10 minutes.

### What was found and fixed

**`GameRmqHttpAddress: "47.145.51.160:None"` (fixed 2026-05-14)**

The gateway's Python service discovers RabbitMQ NodePorts via the Kubernetes API. It successfully found the `amqp` port (NodePort 31982) but not the `http` port (NodePort 30196) because the port name in the service doesn't match what the code expects. This caused every `GatewayDeclareFarmStatus` FLS call to send `GameRmqHttpAddress: "47.145.51.160:None"`.

Fix: added `--RMQGameHttpPort=30196` to the gateway Deployment args via JSON patch. The gateway now sends `GameRmqHttpAddress: "47.145.51.160:30196"` correctly.

**Caveat**: this patch is applied to the Deployment directly. The server-operator regenerates the gateway Deployment from the BattleGroup CR on every restart or update, wiping the patch. Scripts exist to re-apply it:

```sh
# After any battlegroup restart:
~/dune-server/scripts/gateway-patch.sh

# For updates (does update + patch in one step):
~/dune-server/scripts/update.sh
```

### Confirmed correct (do not re-investigate)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| Router port forwarding UDP 7782-7790 | ✅ confirmed in place |
| Router port forwarding TCP 31982 (RMQ AMQP NodePort) | ✅ confirmed in place |
| `DatacenterId` / `-FarmRegion=` / director env var all set to `"North America Test"` | ✅ |
| `GameRmqAddress: "47.145.51.160:31982"` | ✅ |
| `GameRmqHttpAddress: "47.145.51.160:30196"` | ✅ (fixed 2026-05-14) |
| Survival_1 declared to FLS (`DeclareBattlegroupUpdates` with UpDeclarations, partition 1) | ✅ |
| 8-hour heartbeat firing (`HeartbeatUpdatesByPartitionId`) | ✅ (confirmed 13:46 UTC 2026-05-14) |

### FLS declaration chain (for reference)

1. **`GatewayDeclareFarmStatus`** — gateway, once at startup. Registers the farm: `DatacenterId`, `BattlegroupId`, `DisplayName`, `GameRmqAddress`, `GameRmqHttpAddress`. This is the call that had the `None` bug.

2. **`DeclareBattlegroupUpdates`** — director, ~4 minutes after game server pods start. Triggered when the BGD subsystem (BattlegroupDirectorSubsystem) initializes inside the game server and sends its first `ready=true` ServerState via Admin RMQ to the director. Contains `UpDeclarationsByPartitionId` for Survival_1 (partition 1). **Wait at least 5 minutes** after a battlegroup restart before checking the browser. **After a Funcom update, allow longer** (10+ minutes observed) — fresh image pulls, asset reverification, and longer first-run GC sweeps in the game pod push the BGD-ready timestamp further out than a plain restart. Don't start firewall/FLS diagnosis until the pods have had time to settle.

3. **`HeartbeatUpdatesByPartitionId`** — director, every 8 hours (`FlsServerHeartbeatUpdateFrequencySeconds=28800`). Refreshes the declaration to prevent expiry.

**Note on Overmap**: The director pre-loads Overmap's server ID from the `world_partition` DB at startup, so it never sees a DOWN→UP transition and never sends an `UpDeclaration` for it. This is expected — `IsStartingMap: false` for Overmap, so FLS only needs Survival_1 for browser visibility.

## How to update

```sh
# Preferred — full pipeline:
~/dune-server/scripts/update.sh

# Resume after a failure where backup+stop already completed:
~/dune-server/scripts/update.sh --skip-backup --skip-stop --start-after

# Resume after Funcom update completed but DB/gateway/start did not:
~/dune-server/scripts/update.sh --post-update-only --start-after

# What it does internally:
#   1. dune-backup.sh  (host bundle + DB dump unless --skip-backup)
#   2. Stop BattleGroup  (unless --skip-stop; avoids updating live maps)
#   3. steamcmd +app_update 3104830 validate  (runs as the sudo caller with
#      HOME=/home/dune; avoids root's Steam state; the `validate` flag
#      works around Funcom revoking old PTC depot manifests)
#   4. funcom-patches.sh  (re-applies our Slackware patches to
#      server/scripts/setup/experimental_swap.sh, overwritten by SteamCMD)
#   5. battlegroup.sh update  (Funcom flow: steamcmd, operator
#      image+CRD update, BattleGroup CR patched to new image revision —
#      triggers rollout; wrapper clears stale ~/.dune/bin symlinks first
#      because Funcom setup/system.sh uses non-idempotent `ln -s`)
#   6. funcom-patches.sh again  (guards against battlegroup.sh update overwrites)
#   7. db-credentials.sh check/fix  (guards against Postgres password drift)
#   8. If --start-after, start the BattleGroup, then gateway-patch.sh waits
#      for the gateway Deployment and restores --RMQGameHttpPort=30196 if it
#      was wiped)
```

By default the wrapper leaves the battlegroup stopped after a successful update.
Use `~/dune-server/scripts/update.sh --start-after` if you want it restarted
automatically.

The Funcom Windows deployment runs `battlegroup.bat` → `battlegroup.ps1` → SSH into VM → `battlegroup.sh update`. Our setup adds backup, stop, `validate` pre-fetch, Slackware patch re-application, DB credential verification/repair, and the gateway patch around that.

2026-05-15 update note: Funcom added three maps to `experimental_swap.sh`
(`CB_Overland_S_07`, `CB_Overland_S_08`, `CB_Dungeon_ThePit`). The local
`scripts/funcom-patches/experimental_swap.sh` and `.upstream` baseline have
been refreshed with those entries.

2026-05-15 update wrapper note: after a BattleGroup image patch, the DB pod may
exist before Postgres is listening. `db-credentials.sh` now waits for
`pg_isready` before deciding whether credentials are actually broken. The
updated operator may also expose Postgres on `5432`; the guard discovers the
live port from the DatabaseDeployment/status/service instead of assuming the
older `15432` value.

## RAM picture

- Physical RAM: 16 GB
- Conan Exiles Enhanced (co-tenant): ~9.5 GB RSS
- Available: ~6.5 GB
- Game servers in use (Survival_1 + Overmap): ~3.5 Gi RSS (DeepDesert_1 currently stopped)
- **Result: servers fit in available RAM. Swap is not under pressure.**

Total swap: **62 GB** (zram 15.5 + dune-vg SSD 32 + sdc1 15.4) — headroom only.

Overmap's *request* is 200 Mi (swap mode) but actual RSS is ~165 Mi. Survival_1 request is 5 Gi against ~3.3 Gi actual. Wide gap between request and reality — room to start more maps.

**After motherboard swap (64 GB):** remove the 200 Mi swap-mode request from Overmap; all servers comfortably in RAM.

## Map management

```sh
# See all 28 maps and which are on/off
~/dune-server/scripts/map-toggle.sh list

# Start or stop a map
~/dune-server/scripts/map-toggle.sh start DeepDesert_1
~/dune-server/scripts/map-toggle.sh stop  DeepDesert_1
```

**Important:** Do not patch `ServerSet` or `ServerGroup` replicas directly. Starting a map requires patching both the `BattleGroup CR` and the `ServerSetScale` — `map-toggle.sh` handles both. Patching only the BattleGroup CR leaves the map stuck in `Stopped` phase because `ServerSetScale` (the final pod-creation trigger) does not auto-update.

After a k3s restart, maps do not come back automatically — use `map-toggle.sh start` or `battlegroup.sh restart` (followed by `gateway-patch.sh`).

## VPA memory recommendations

VPA 1.6.0 recommender deployed 2026-05-13. Off mode — recommendations only, no auto-apply.

**Standard workloads** (9 VPA objects): postgres, rabbitmq, gateway, director, text-router, filebrowser, db-util-mon, db-util-pghero, bgd-deploy. Recommendations populate after ~24h.

```sh
sudo kubectl get vpa -n funcom-seabass-sh-db3533a2d5a25fb-xyyxbx
sudo kubectl describe vpa <name> -n funcom-seabass-sh-db3533a2d5a25fb-xyyxbx
```

**Game servers** use Funcom's ServerSet CRD — VPA can't target them. Use `watch-gameservers.sh`:

```sh
~/dune-server/scripts/vpa/watch-gameservers.sh --once
```

Baseline readings (2026-05-13, single user): Survival_1 ~3.3 Gi, Overmap ~165 Mi, DeepDesert_1 ~954 Mi.

## Security hardening (2026-05-14) ✅

All items applied. Details in CLAUDE.md § Security.

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| firewalld with iptables backend (k3s-safe) | ✅ configured, public + trusted zones, boot entry in rc.local |
| SSH key-only auth (RSA-4096 from defiant) | ✅ PasswordAuthentication + KbdInteractiveAuthentication both `no` |
| `~/.dune/*.yaml` permissions 600 | ✅ |
| PostgreSQL passwords rotated | ✅ ALTER USER applied; CR + on-disk YAML updated |
| k3s API `bind-address: 127.0.0.1` | ❌ REVERTED — breaks pod→API DNAT; firewall is sufficient |
| SNMP disabled | ✅ off |
| FLS token expiry tracking | ✅ in dune-ctl (`token-check`); token expires 2027-05-08, rotate by 2027-04-08 |

## LAN client workaround (defiant / 192.168.254.17)

The Frontier NVG468MQ router does not support NAT hairpin. LAN clients connecting
via the FLS browser hang because the external IP (47.145.51.160) is unreachable
from inside the LAN through the router.

Fix applied on defiant via firewalld direct rule (nat OUTPUT DNAT):

```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 nat OUTPUT 0 \
    -d 47.145.51.160 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.254.200
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

Any other LAN client that wants to connect needs the same rule (or equivalent
iptables/nftables OUTPUT DNAT). The rule is permanent and survives reboots.

## Hagga Basin travel timeout — root cause and status

**Symptom**: Player gets P34 timeout entering Hagga Basin (Survival_1) after the tutorial.

**Root cause (found 2026-05-15)**: arrakis had a stale nftables `table inet firewalld` active while firewalld was configured for `FirewallBackend=iptables`. The correct iptables firewalld rules allowed Dune UDP `7782-7790`, but the stale nft firewalld input hook still rejected incoming client packets with `ICMP admin prohibited`.

**Confirmed evidence**:

- `tcpdump -ni any 'host 192.168.254.17 and (udp port 7783 or icmp)'` showed client UDP reaching `192.168.254.200:7783`.
- The same capture showed arrakis replying with `ICMP host 192.168.254.200 unreachable - admin prohibited filter`.
- `iptables-save` showed the iptables firewalld path accepted LAN traffic via `IN_trusted`.
- `nft list tables` still showed `table inet firewalld`, and `nft list ruleset -a` showed stale nft firewalld input chains ending in `reject with icmpx admin-prohibited`.
- After `nft delete table inet firewalld`, tcpdump immediately showed two-way UDP traffic and the player loaded into Hagga Basin.

**Fix applied**:

```sh
nft delete table inet firewalld
firewall-cmd --reload
```

`/etc/firewalld/firewalld.conf` has `FirewallBackend=iptables`. After `firewall-cmd --reload`, `nft list tables` no longer shows `table inet firewalld`, so the stale table did not return.

**Do not use the old S2S-window workaround**: `scripts/s2s-watchdog.sh` was removed. The previous theory that players had to connect during a short Farm-session window was wrong for this incident.

**Related cleanup**: DeepDesert_1 was also corrected to a clean stopped state (`BattleGroup replicas=0`, `ServerSetScale=0`). The previous split state (`replicas=1`, `ServerSetScale=0`) caused confusing farm-size/partition-8 noise in logs and should not be treated as normal.

## What still needs doing

- [x] ~~Server browser visibility~~ — resolved 2026-05-14, "Slackware-Arrakis" visible in EXPERIMENTAL list
- [x] ~~Security hardening~~ — resolved 2026-05-14; see above
- [ ] Re-apply gateway patch after every restart: `~/dune-server/scripts/gateway-patch.sh`
- [ ] If travel times out again, first check for stale nft firewalld state: `nft list tables` must not show `table inet firewalld`
- [ ] Confirm motherboard swap outcome (64 GB recognised?) — reboot and verify with `free -h`
- [ ] After board swap: raise Overmap request back to its natural limit (remove 200 Mi swap patch via `experimental_swap.sh`)
- [x] Add and verify Dune backup/restore runbook and host backup wrapper — full DB backup succeeded 2026-05-15; see `BACKUP-RESTORE.md` and `scripts/dune-backup.sh`
- [ ] Schedule Dune backup jobs writing to `/srv/backups/dune/`
- [ ] Set up Conan backup jobs writing to `/srv/backups/conan/`
- [ ] Off-server backup strategy (rsync to NAS / rclone to cloud — TBD)
- [ ] Create `settings.conf` (`printf '\n\n\n47.145.51.160\n' > ~/.dune/settings.conf`) — cosmetic, no known runtime failures
- [ ] **Rotate FLS token before 2027-04-08** (expires 2027-05-08) — update BattleGroup CR args (28 occurrences) + re-apply gateway patch
- [ ] Build dune-ctl (Rust TUI + web) — FLS token expiry warning is planned feature

## Bootstrapping fixes applied (fresh cluster workarounds)

The Funcom scripts assume a cloud-provisioned base — these were done manually:

- **cert-manager v1.8.0** installed via official manifest (not in download package)
- **ServiceMonitor CRD** installed (prometheus-operator CRD needed by database operator)
- **Funcom operator deployments** created from scratch (namespace, SA, CRB, Deployments)
- **Webhook TLS** — self-signed cert mounted into all 4 operator pods
- **operator.sh** — fresh-install workaround: `kubectl replace` fails when CRDs don't yet exist. Before running `setup.sh` on a new cluster, manually apply CRDs with `sudo kubectl apply --server-side -f ~/dune-server/server/images/operators/crds/`. Not auto-patched — only matters during bootstrap
- **experimental_swap.sh** — Slackware patches now managed via `scripts/funcom-patches/`; re-applied automatically by `funcom-patches.sh` after every `update.sh` run
- **steamcmd wrapper** — `/usr/local/bin/steamcmd` execs `~dune/steamcmd/steamcmd.sh` (a bare symlink fails because steamcmd uses `dirname $0` to find its own files). Created by `root-setup.sh` Step 9
- **world.sh** — added Europe Test / North America Test regions to the region menu (one-time, only used during world creation; if lost, re-add manually before re-running)
- **memory-focused-scheduler** — host daemon deployed; auto-starts via `/etc/rc.d/rc.local`
- **root-setup.sh** ✅ ran 2026-05-13 — k3s shims, rc.k3s, sudoers, LVM swap + backup volume
- **experimental_swap.sh** ✅ ran 2026-05-13 — swap enabled, all map memory requests patched down
- **gateway `--RMQGameHttpPort=30196`** ✅ fixed 2026-05-14 — see `gateway-patch.sh`

## Storage (as of 2026-05-13)

| Device | Use |
|---|---|
| `/dev/sdc2` 916 GB HDD | btrfs root |
| `/dev/sdc1` 15.4 GB | swap pri -2 |
| `/dev/zram0` 15.5 GB | swap pri 100 |
| `dune-vg/swap` 32 GB SSD | swap pri -1 |
| `dune-vg/backups` ~150 GB SSD | `/srv/backups`, btrfs+zstd |

## Boot sequence (on reboot)

rc.local starts automatically:
1. firewalld
2. QEMU guest agent
3. `memory-focused-scheduler` daemon

Then manually:
```sh
sudo rc-service k3s start
```

After k3s is up, maps do not restart automatically. Start them, then re-apply the gateway patch:
```sh
~/dune-server/server/scripts/battlegroup.sh restart
~/dune-server/scripts/gateway-patch.sh
# or start maps individually:
~/dune-server/scripts/map-toggle.sh start Survival_1
~/dune-server/scripts/map-toggle.sh start Overmap
~/dune-server/scripts/map-toggle.sh start DeepDesert_1
~/dune-server/scripts/gateway-patch.sh
```
